## The Basics

### 1. Start by creating a collection
This is how you organize things. For example, you might create a collection called `Personal Health`.

### 2. Add a progress tracker
Let's start with something simple, like  `Body Weight`.

### 3. Set a goal
For our example, we might set a goal of `180lbs` for our `Body Weight` tracker.

### 4. Add data points to your trackers over time
In our example, we'd want to capture our body weight every day. You can add as many data points as you want, and you can add them whenever you want. For example, you might add a data point every day, or every week, or every month. It's up to you.

### 5. Telemetry will predict when you'll reach your goal 🔮
Telemetry will automatically predict when you'll reach that goal. The more data you add over time, the more accurate the prediction will be. For example, Telemetry might predict that you'll reach `180lbs` in 2 months. It's magic.
